# FFX CSR RANDO
A program for skipping cutscenes.
<!--If you encounter any bugs or have any questions, please open an issue on GitHub or contact us on the [FFX Speedrun Discord](https://discord.gg/X3qXHWG).-->

### Important

* This mod is designed and tested to be used for speedruns only. It's been repurposed to be used with a specific randomizer mod. Using this mod for normal playthroughs will quickly break the game. It is strongly recommended to manually save regularly and not rely on auto-saves.

* This mod currently only works on Windows using the Steam release of FFX (though there has been some success of it working on Linux, tbd).

### Usage:

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page here](https://github.com/Omnises/FFXCutsceneRemover/releases).

2. Launch Final Fantasy X (via Fahrenheit).

3. Launch FFXSCSR.exe

You do not need to start a new game in order to gain the cutscene skipping effects of the mod, however, if you start from a save file you may find that it takes a while before the cutscenes start skipping.
